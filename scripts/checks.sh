# The checks CI runs (.github/workflows/checks.yml), runnable locally from the top of the
# repository. specs/ is a spec format 2 root; the contract is driver-lab's
# skills/spec-format/SKILL.md and the tool is its skills/spec-format/scripts/spec.py.
#
#   scripts/checks.sh [--mode pr|main] <step> <driver-lab checkout> [<further root>...]
#
# Steps:
#   check      spec.py check specs (further roots as --context-root) --require-license
#              --require-verified <mode>: nothing lands unverified or with a stale record
#   resolve    spec.py resolve on every spec under specs/, so each pinned repository a spec
#              cites is fetched and its src and DT anchors and per-file licenses are checked
#              (RESOLVE_SRC=1 only, below); specs without repos entries resolve nothing
#   render     spec.py render, Markdown view and viewer (--format md and html), each file's own
#              view and, when further roots are given, the merged views; a view that cannot be
#              built fails the step
#   self-test  prove the license gate with this repository's root marker on driver-lab's
#              format 2 fixtures (below)
#   all        the four in order
#
# --mode is the verification policy (design D19). pr (the default): every fact must be current,
# and a fact staled through a reference into a further root is an error. main: such an
# upstream-stale fact is a warning, so an upstream merge never turns this repository's main red;
# the next pull request here must re-verify it. CI passes pr on pull requests, main otherwise.
#
# A further root is another spec root read beside specs/ so that overlays and references
# resolve. It is context only: its own findings are warnings here and fail only in its own
# repository's checks. hardware-specs-docs passes none; hardware-specs-permissive requires one,
# hardware-specs-docs' specs/; hardware-specs-gpl requires two, hardware-specs-docs' specs/ then
# hardware-specs-permissive's specs/.
#
# RESOLVE_SRC=1 (CI sets it) makes the resolve step fetch each cited repository at its pinned
# commit over HTTPS. An entry whose fetch exceeds SRC_FETCH_LIMIT_MB (default 50) or the
# fetch timeout is skipped and counted in the summary; any other failure (a commit, file or
# symbol that does not exist, a license line that disagrees) fails the step. The limit bounds
# what is kept, not what is transferred. Unset, resolve fetches nothing and says so.
#
# Needs bash 3.2 or later and a Python with driver-lab's skills/spec-format/requirements.txt
# installed with pip's --require-hashes:
#   python3 -m venv .venv-spec
#   .venv-spec/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r <driver-lab>/skills/spec-format/requirements.txt
#   CHECKS_PYTHON=.venv-spec/bin/python scripts/checks.sh all <driver-lab>
# The interpreter is $CHECKS_PYTHON when set (CI sets it to such a virtualenv), otherwise
# python3. Without the pinned packages every step exits 3 ("missing dependency").
#
# Exit codes: 0 passed, 1 a check failed, 2 usage error, 3 missing precondition.
